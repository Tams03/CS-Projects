# 🧊 SmartFridge – IoT Food Management System
**Course:** IOT
**Grade:** 92/100  
**Type:** IoT & Mobile Application  
**Technologies:** Python, OpenCV, Pyzbar, Firebase, Pyrebase, Flutter, Gemini AI, Raspberry Pi, OpenFoodFacts API

---

## Overview
SmartFridge is an IoT-based system designed to manage home food inventory intelligently: barcode-based scanning with a Raspberry Pi camera, a Flutter mobile app, and Firebase for real-time sync. It sends expiration and low-stock alerts and provides AI-powered recipe suggestions.

---

## Problem & Motivation
Households often waste food because they forget what’s in the fridge or when items expire.  
Manual inventory checks and planning shopping lists take time and effort.  
SmartFridge solves this by automatically detecting items, tracking inventory, and notifying users before food expires.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Reduce food waste through real-time expiration alerts  
- Save time with automatic shopping lists and remote access  
- Provide a modern, intuitive, AI-assisted user experience  

---

## 👩‍💻 My Role
- Implemented barcode recognition using **OpenCV + Pyzbar**  
- Integrated **Firebase real-time database** for inventory tracking  
- Created the user manual and final documentation  

---

## 🧩 System Architecture
The system follows a **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)** with four layers:

1. **Application Layer** – Flutter mobile app (Android 8.0+).  
   Displays inventory, shows alerts, interacts with AI Gemini assistant.  
2. **Service Layer** – Handles barcode recognition and product identification using **OpenCV + Pyzbar** and **OpenFoodFacts APIs**.  
3. **Business Layer** – Manages logic for expiration tracking, alert scheduling, and shopping list generation.  
4. **Data Layer** – Stores inventory, dates, and user data in **Firebase**, synchronized in real time.

## ⚙️ Hardware Components
- **Raspberry Pi** with built-in camera for barcode scanning  
- **Wi-Fi module** for real-time synchronization with Firebase  
- *(Future feature)*: Pressure sensors for detecting item removal and quantity
