## Overview
SmartFridge is an IoT-based food management system that tracks inventory and expiration dates using a Raspberry Pi and a mobile app interface. The system provides a simple way for users to manage food efficiently and reduce waste.

---

## Problem & Motivation
Food waste is a major global issue, and manually tracking expiration dates is time-consuming and error-prone. SmartFridge automates inventory tracking and sends timely notifications, helping users prevent unnecessary waste and optimize food usage.

---

## Goals
- Reduce food waste through real-time expiration alerts  
- Save time with automatic shopping lists and remote access  
- Provide a modern, intuitive, AI-assisted user experience  

---

## My Role
This project was completed as part of a group. My specific contributions included:
- Designed and implemented the Raspberry Pi hardware setup and barcode scanning scripts
- Integrated Firebase real-time database for inventory tracking and organized the data
- Created the user manual and final documentation for the project

---

## System Architecture / How it Works
- Raspberry Pi captures images of food items and scans barcodes to identify and log them.  
- Data is stored and managed in Firebase, allowing real-time synchronization with the mobile app.  
- The mobile app provides users with an up-to-date inventory and sends notifications for expiring items.  
- Historical data is logged to track changes in inventory and user behavior.

---

## Features
- Tracks inventory automatically using barcode scanning
- Sends notifications for soon-to-expire food items  
- Provides smart suggestions using Gemini AI (e.g., “What can I make for lunch?”)  
- Updates the mobile app in real-time  
- Maintains historical logs of added and removed items

---

## Prototype
- The prototype demonstrates a fully functional SmartFridge setup, including hardware scanning and mobile app interface.  
- Users can test scanning different items, observe the real-time updates, and verify notification delivery.

---

## Demo / Instructions
- Access the prototype demo (link provided).  
- Follow setup instructions in the README to replicate the system using the provided scripts and mobile app files.  
- Test the barcode scanning and ensure notifications are delivered correctly on the mobile app.
